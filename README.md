# Monte Carlo Simulation R Code Repository

R Code accompanying Sage Monte Carlo Simulation Chapter 

Each R file corresponds to an example in the chapter. All code only requires base R functions with the exception of the Metropolis-Hasting example which requires the `mcse` function from the `mcmcse` package. 

Running the code with the `set.seed()` line will yield same results as in the text.
